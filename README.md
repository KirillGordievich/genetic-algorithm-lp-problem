genetic algorithm for numerical function optimization

Visualization of genetic algorithm for function optimization. 
Find the Maximum Value of F(x1, x2) =  2*x1 - 0.1*x1^2 + 3*x2 - 0.1*x2^2 
with constraints:
5 * x1 + 2 * x2 less than or equal to 30
8 * x1 + 11 * x2 less than or equal to 60
x1  is greater than  0
x2  is greater than 0
